This code was used for a final project for MATH 5300 (Mathematics of Finance) at the University of Pennsylvania during Fall 2024. 
This is code for a simple stock price simulator which is based off of a geometric Brownian motion with some added time correlations; 
this also implements two trading algorithms based off of "online" machine learning algorithms, 
i.e., machine learning algorithms for sequential (as opposed to batch) settings. 

This code accompanies a 15-page writeup, which formalizes algorithmic trading as an online learning problem,
and proves formal guarantees for the performance of two trading algorithms which are implemented in this repository. The full writeup 
can be found at this Overleaf document: https://www.overleaf.com/read/kwqhfvzvrrjh#4cc048.
